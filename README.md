📘 Practice 3 — OOP, Functions and Lambda
📌 Overview

This practice contains examples and implementations related to:

Classes and Objects

Constructors (__init__)

Attributes and Methods

Inheritance

Method Overriding

Multiple Inheritance

super() Function

Functions (basic, arguments, return values)

*args and **kwargs

Lambda Expressions

filter(), map(), and sorted() with lambda

The purpose of this practice is to demonstrate understanding of object-oriented programming and functional programming concepts in Python.

🏗 Classes
Constructor (__init__)

Used to initialize object attributes when an object is created.

Example topics included:

Creating objects with parameters

Initializing multiple attributes

Using constructors in inheritance

Attributes (Variables)

Classes contain:

Instance variables (defined inside __init__)

Class variables (shared between objects)

Examples demonstrate:

Storing object data

Accessing attributes

Modifying attributes

Methods

Methods define object behavior.

Examples include:

Mathematical operations

Updating object state

Returning computed values

🔗 Inheritance
Basic Inheritance

A child class inherits properties and methods from a parent class.

Method Overriding

A child class redefines a method from the parent class.

Multiple Inheritance

A class inherits from more than one parent class.

super() Function

Used to call methods (especially constructors) from the parent class.

🧮 Functions
Basic Functions

Functions without arguments.

Functions with Arguments

Functions that accept parameters.

Return Values

Functions that return results using return.

*args and **kwargs

*args allows multiple positional arguments.

**kwargs allows multiple keyword arguments.

⚡ Lambda Expressions
Basic Lambda

Anonymous one-line functions.

Lambda with filter()

Used to filter elements from a list.

Lambda with map()

Used to transform elements of a list.

Lambda with sorted()

Used to customize sorting behavior.

🎯 Learning Goals

After completing this practice, the following concepts are demonstrated:

Understanding of object-oriented programming

Working with constructors and attributes

Implementing inheritance and overriding

Using super() correctly

Writing reusable functions

Applying functional programming tools (lambda, map, filter, sorted)

If you want, I can:

Make a shorter version (simpler English)

Make a more “academic” version for grading

Add examples section with code snippets

Add author and course info block
